# Fullstack-challenge
This is what I did for a 4-hours challenge that is intended to be done by a fullstack developer. 
The backend is done in [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework, and the frontend in [React](https://reactjs.org/), using [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## Description (as it was given to me)
Build a react application that can display NFTs from this collection:
https://opensea.io/collection/mystical-wizards
Expected UI should look similar to this link above, from Opensea.

Acceptance criteria:
Use Nestjs on the backend and React on the frontend
Users must be able to connect with their metamask wallet
Use Opensea’s API: https://docs.opensea.io/reference/api-overview

Please share your code when done as well as a short Loom video (less than 5 min) explaining what you’ve done
